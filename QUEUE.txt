A queue is a data structure used for storing data (similar to Linked Lists and Stacks). In queue, the
order in which data arrives is important. In general, a queue is a line of people or things waiting
to be served in sequential order starting at the beginning of the line or sequence.

Definition: A queue is an ordered list in which insertions are done at one end (rear) and
deletions are done at other end (front). The first element to be inserted is the first one to be
deleted. Hence, it is called First in First out (FIFO) or Last in Last out (LILO) list.
